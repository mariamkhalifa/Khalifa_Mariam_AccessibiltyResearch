WEBVTT - Some title

00:08.700 --> 00:13.305
There is a family near Salisburg that needs a governess until September.

00:13.445 --> 00:13.975
September?

00:14.005 --> 00:16.595
To take care of seven children

00:16.640 --> 00:18.015
Seven children?

00:18.015 --> 00:20.015
Come out of that water at once!

00:20.015 --> 00:22.015
Do you like children, Maria?

00:22.015 --> 00:24.015
Oh, yes but seven!

00:24.315 --> 00:26.930
I will tell Captain Von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.

00:28.975 --> 00:29.985
Captain?

00:30.995 --> 00:33.550
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy

00:33.610 --> 00:35.195
a fine man and a brave one.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.010
Tell me, do you think the Captain would bring more material if I ask him?

00:38.090 --> 00:40.995
How many dresses does a governess need?

00:41.035 --> 00:42.950
Not for me, for the children.

00:45.010 --> 00:47.990
The Von Trapp children don't play, they march.

00:50.590 --> 00:51.450
- But they‘re children!

00:51.845 --> 00:52.630
- Yes.

00:52.665 --> 00:54.665
And I'm their father.

00:54.685 --> 00:55.720
Goodnight.

01:07.005 --> 01:13.945
Do you mean to tell me that my children have been roaming about Salzburg dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?

01:14.995 --> 01:17.005
And having a marvellous time!

01:18.005 --> 01:21.945
Fraulein, are you this much trouble at the Abby?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.290
Oh, much more, Sir

01:25.400 --> 01:27.140
Why did they send you back to us?

01:27.160 --> 01:29.955
They didn't send me back, Mother, I left.

01:30.005 --> 01:32.980
Is it true fraulein Maria isn‘t coming back?

01:33.005 --> 01:34.995
I can‘t face him again.

01:36.005 --> 01:39.020
There's nothing more irresistible to a man than a woman who‘s in love with him.

01:40.005 --> 01:40.660
In love with him?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.020
Of course. What makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you.

01:46.005 --> 01:49.020
There were times when we would look at each other...

01:49.040 --> 01:51.020
Oh, Mother, I could hardly breathe

01:52.435 --> 01:52.995
Are you in love with him?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.485
I never felt that way before.

01:56.005 --> 01:56.775
Maria.

01:57.005 --> 02:00.000
You have to live the life you were born to live.

02:05.005 --> 02:10.005
Somewhere out there there‘s a young lady who I think will never be a nun

00:42.980 --> 00:44.980
I want to make them some play clothes
