WEBVTT - Some title

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
So, what's the show about?

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
It's about nothing

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
No story?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
No, forget the story

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
You gotta have a story

00:06.440 --> 00:08.995
Remember when we were waiting for that table at that Chinese restaurant that time

00:08.995 --> 00:14.005
It's not fair that people are seated first come first served. It should be based on who is hungriest

00:14.005 --> 00:16.020
That could be a TV show

00:16.195 --> 00:18.010
And who is on the show? Who are the characters?

00:18.045 --> 00:19.005
I could be a character

00:19.030 --> 00:19.990
You?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.780
I think lustrous hair is very important for me

00:21.930 --> 00:23.710
You...She... violated

00:23.825 --> 00:24.980
I did it!

00:25.560 --> 00:26.690
I'm a character

00:27.005 --> 00:28.560
People are always saying to me, you know, you're quite the character

00:28.600 --> 00:30.990
Finally, my stupidity pays off!

00:31.285 --> 00:32.415
And who else is on the show?

00:32.450 --> 00:33.505
Elaine could be a character

00:33.565 --> 00:36.005
You don't think I could put [inaudible] on the seats?

00:36.035 --> 00:37.005
Get outta here!

00:37.995 --> 00:40.765
Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?

00:40.860 --> 00:41.820
Kramer

00:41.920 --> 00:42.565
Yeah

00:42.685 --> 00:45.090
[Wierd sounds]

00:45.585 --> 00:46.945
[screaming]

00:47.010 --> 00:48.155
Now, he's a character!

00:48.190 --> 00:48.1000
I'm Kramer

00:49.025 --> 00:50.225
And it's about nothing?

00:50.290 --> 00:51.345
Absolutely nothing

00:51.390 --> 00:53.020
Seinfeld on 2

00:54.010 --> 00:55.565
I think you may have something here

00:55.565 --> 00:57.565
[Audience laughter]
