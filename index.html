                You and me
                We used to be together
                Every day together always
                I really feel
                That I'm losing my best friend
                I can't believe this could be the end
                It looks as though you're letting go
                And if it's real
                Well I don't want to know
                Don't speak
                I know just what you're saying
                So please stop explaining
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                Don't speak
                I know what you're thinking
                I don't need your reasons
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                Our memories
                They can be inviting
                But some are altogether mighty frightening
                As we die, both you and I
                With my head in my hands I sit and cry
                Don't speak
                I know just what you're saying
                So please stop explaining
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                (No, no, no) Don't speak
                I know what you're thinking
                And I don't need your reasons
                Don't tell me 'cause it hurts
                It's allâ€¦
